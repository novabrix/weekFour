# Javascript Functions

With some basic JavaScript principles in hand, we can now expand our skills out even further by exploring functions.  Finish each task in order as the concepts build on one another.

## Set Up The Project With Git

**Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:**

* [✅] Create a forked copy of this project.
* [✅] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Gabi's by mistake!).
* [✅] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
* [✅] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
* [✅] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.
* [✅] Submit your assignment in the student portal

## MVP

* [✅] Review the contents of the [challenges.js](challenges.js)
* [✅] Complete the problems provided to you but skip over stretch problems until you are complete with every other JS file first.

## Stretch Goals

* [✅] Go back through the stretch problems that you skipped over and complete as many as you can.
